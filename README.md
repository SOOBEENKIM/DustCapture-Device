# üåÄ Bio-Inspired Fine Dust Filter for Automotive Exhaust Systems

This repository presents a research project that **mimics the vortex-based cross-step filtration mechanism of fish gills** to develop an efficient and detachable **fine dust filtering device** for automobile exhaust systems. The project was conducted as part of a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) R&E program.

## üß™ Project Summary

- **Title**: Development of a Fine Dust Collection Device Mimicking the Cross-Step Filtration of Fish Gills
- **Institution**: Incheon Science and Arts Gifted High School
- **Team Members**: SooBeen Kim, HoJin Lee, MinSeok Song
- **Main Tool**: SolidWorks, FlowDesign, 3D Printing

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Biomimicry**: Analyze the cross-step filtration structure of filter-feeding fish gills (e.g., tilapia) and replicate it to design a vortex-inducing filter.
2. **Simulation & Modeling**: Model fluid dynamics and dust behavior using SolidWorks and FlowDesign.
3. **Prototype Development**: Create a detachable, energy-efficient filter that fits into a car exhaust pipe and is easy to install/remove.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Experiment with fluid and particle flow to verify the dust filtering efficiency.

## üß¨ Methodology Overview

### 1. Biological and Mechanical Analysis

- Dissected tilapia to study gill structures and measured rib spacing and groove depth.
- Investigated automobile exhaust muffler structure and identified optimal filter installation points.

### 2. Filter Design & Simulation

- Designed three filter shapes (circular, oval, square) based on fish gill geometry using SolidWorks.
- Used FlowDesign to analyze vortex generation and drag coefficients.
- Verified that circular shapes with d-type rib structures were most effective at generating stable vortices.

### 3. Fluid Flow Experiment

- Built a custom test tank and inserted 3D-printed filters.
- Used **rhodamine dye** to visualize flow patterns under controlled motor speeds.
- Circular filters produced the most consistent and effective vortices.

### 4. Prototype Fabrication & Field Testing

- Created final prototypes with varying thicknesses using 3D printing.
- Simulated automobile exhaust conditions using an acrylic tube, fine dust (talc), and vacuum suction.
- Observed effective dust reduction in downstream air quality measurements.

## üìä Key Results

- **Vortex Generation**: Best observed at 5V motor output and with circular filter design.
- **Drag Analysis**:
  - Circular: Cd = 1.421
  - Oval: Cd = 2.458
  - Square: Cd = 0.842
- **Dust Filtration Effectiveness**: Proven via visible reduction in dust particles after passing through the prototype filter.

## üìå Significance

This project proposes a novel **biomimetic air filtration solution** that can be integrated into vehicle exhaust systems to reduce particulate emissions. The design is low-cost, detachable, and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications. Beyond automobiles, the filter concept can be adapted to industrial and environmental use cases requiring efficient particulate separation in fluid flows.
